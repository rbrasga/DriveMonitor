# DriveMonitor
Drive Monitor will send the collected statistics, including SMART data, to a cluster of nodes for later processing.

Will try to include everything that is not proprietary information.

Proprietary information includes access to Toshiba Internal SSD statistics. This API will not be included, and will be left as a file with only the method names (API calls) defined. The methods themselves will not be defined.

There will be a separate project for saving all data points to Cassandra, because it requires additional configuration and software.
